### CVE ID

* [CVE-2013-0263](http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/89939)

### GEM NAME

* rack

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 1.1.6`
* `~> 1.2.8`
* `~> 1.3.10`
* `~> 1.4.5`
* `>= 1.5.2`

### DESCRIPTION

Rack contains a flaw that is due to an error in the Rack::Session::Cookie
function. Users of the Marshal session cookie encoding (the default), are
subject to a timing attack that may lead an attacker to execute arbitrary
code. This attack is more practical against 'cloud' users as intra-cloud
latencies are sufficiently low to make the attack viable.
