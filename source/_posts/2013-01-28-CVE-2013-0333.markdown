### CVE ID

* [CVE-2013-0333](http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/89594)

### GEM NAME

* activesupport

### FRAMEWORK

* rails

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 2.3.16`
* `>= 3.0.20`

### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails contains a flaw in the JSON parser. Rails supports multiple
parsing backends, one of which involves transforming JSON into YAML via the
YAML parser. With a specially crafted payload, an attacker can subvert the
backend into decoding a subset of YAML. This may allow a remote attacker to
bypass restrictions, allowing them to bypass authentication systems, inject
arbitrary SQL, inject and execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on
a Rails application.
