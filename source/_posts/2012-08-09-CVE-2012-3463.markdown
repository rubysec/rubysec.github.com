### CVE ID

* [CVE-2012-3463](http://osvdb.org/84515)

### GEM NAME

* actionpack

### FRAMEWORK

* rails

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 3.0.17`
* `~> 3.1.8`
* `>= 3.2.8`

### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack. This flaw exists because input passed via the prompt value is not
properly sanitized by the select_tag helper method before returning it to
the user. This may allow a user to create a specially crafted request that
would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust
relationship between their browser and the server.
