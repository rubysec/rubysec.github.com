  title: HTTP Request Smuggling in Agoo
  description: |
    agoo through 2.12.3 allows request smuggling attacks where agoo is used
    as a backend and a frontend proxy also being vulnerable. It is possible to conduct
    HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header twice. Furthermore,
    invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be
    leveraged for TE:CL smuggling attacks.
