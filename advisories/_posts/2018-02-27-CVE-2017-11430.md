  title: omniauth-saml authentication bypass via incorrect XML canonicalization and
    DOM traversal
  date: 2018-02-27
  description: |
    OmniAuth OmnitAuth-SAML 1.9.0 and earlier may incorrectly utilize the
    results of XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs in such a way that an attacker
    may be able to manipulate the SAML data without invalidating the cryptographic signature,
    allowing the attack to potentially bypass authentication to SAML service providers.
