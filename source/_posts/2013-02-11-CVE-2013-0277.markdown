### CVE ID

* [CVE-2013-0277](http://direct.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/90073)

### GEM NAME

* activerecord

### FRAMEWORK

* rails

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 2.3.17`
* `>= 3.1.0`

### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails contains a flaw in the +serialize+ helper in the Active Record.
The issue is triggered when the system is configured to allow users to
directly provide values to be serialized and deserialized using YAML.
With a specially crafted YAML attribute, a remote attacker can deserialize
arbitrary YAML and execute code associated with it.
