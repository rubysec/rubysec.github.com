  title: Remote code execution in bootstrap-sass
  date: 2019-04-04
  description: "Arbitrary code execution (via backdoor code, when \ndownloaded from
    rubygems.org) was discovered in \nbootstrap-sass 3.2.0.3.\n\nUsers are advised
    to upgrade immediately to 3.2.0.4\n\nAn unauthenticated attacker can craft the
    ___cfduid cookie value\nwith base64 arbitrary code to be executed via eval(),
    which can\nbe leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the target system. \n(Note
    that there are three underscore characters in the cookie name. \nThis is unrelated
    to the __cfduid cookie that is legitimately used by \nCloudflare.)\n"
  unaffected_versions:
  - "<= 3.2.0.2"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.2.0.4"
