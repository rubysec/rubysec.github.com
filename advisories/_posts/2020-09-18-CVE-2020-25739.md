  title: Gon gem lack of escaping certain input when outputting as JSON
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in the gon gem before gon-6.4.0 for Ruby. MultiJson
    does not honor the escape_mode parameter to escape fields as an XSS
    protection mechanism. To mitigate, json_dumper.rb in gon now does escaping
    for XSS by default without relying on MultiJson.
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 6.4.0"
  cvss_v2: 4.3
  cvss_v3: 6.1
