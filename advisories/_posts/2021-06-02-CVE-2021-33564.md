  title: Remote code execution in Dragonfly
  description: |
    An argument injection vulnerability in the Dragonfly gem before 1.4.0
    for Ruby allows remote attackers to read and write to arbitrary files via a crafted
    URL when the verify_url option is disabled. This may lead to code execution. The
    problem occurs because the generate and process features mishandle use of the ImageMagick
    convert utility.
  cvss_v3: 9.8
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.4.0"
