### CVE ID

* [CVE-2011-0739](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/70667)

### GEM NAME

* mail

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `>= 2.2.15`

### DESCRIPTION

Mail Gem for Ruby contains a flaw related to the failure to properly sanitise
input passed from an email from address in the 'deliver()' function in
'lib/mail/network/delivery_methods/sendmail.rb' before being used as a
command line argument. This may allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary
shell commands.
