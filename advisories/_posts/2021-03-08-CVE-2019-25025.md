  title: activerecord-session_store Timing Attack
  description: |
    The `activerecord-session_store` (aka Active Record Session Store) component
    through 1.1.3 for Ruby on Rails does not use a constant-time approach when delivering
    information about whether a guessed session ID is valid. Consequently, remote attackers
    can leverage timing discrepancies to achieve a correct guess in a relatively short
    amount of time. This is a related issue to CVE-2019-16782.

    ## Recommendation
    Users should upgrade to `activerecord-session_store` version 2.0.0 or later.
  cvss_v3: 5.9
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 2.0.0"
