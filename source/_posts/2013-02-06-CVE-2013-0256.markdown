### CVE ID

* [CVE-2013-0256](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/90004)

### GEM NAME

* rdoc

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 3.9.5`
* `~> 3.12.1`
* `>= 4.0`

### DESCRIPTION

Doc documentation generated by rdoc 2.3.0 through rdoc 3.12 and prereleases
up to rdoc 4.0.0.preview2.1 are vulnerable to an XSS exploit. This exploit
may lead to cookie disclosure to third parties.

The exploit exists in darkfish.js which is copied from the RDoc install
location to the generated documentation.

RDoc is a static documentation generation tool. Patching the library itself
is insufficient to correct this exploit.

This exploit was discovered by Evgeny Ermakov <corwmh@gmail.com>.
