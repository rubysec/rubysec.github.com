### CVE ID

* [CVE-2013-0269](http://direct.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/90074)

### GEM NAME

* json

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 1.5.4`
* `~> 1.6.7`
* `>= 1.7.7`

### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that may allow a remote denial of service.
The issue is due to the JSON gem being tricked in to generating Ruby symbols
during the parsing of certain JSON documents. Since Ruby symbols are not
garbage collected, a remote attacker can crash a users system. This also may
allow the attacker to create arbitrary objects that may be used to bypass
certain security mechanisms and potentially allow SQL injection attacks to
be conducted.
