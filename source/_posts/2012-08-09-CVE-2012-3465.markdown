### CVE ID

* [CVE-2012-3465](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/84513)

### GEM NAME

* actionpack

### FRAMEWORK

* rails

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 3.0.17`
* `~> 3.1.8`
* `>= 3.2.8`

### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack. This flaw exists because the application does not validate input
passed via the 'strip_tags' helper method before returning it to the user.
This may allow a user to create a specially crafted request that would
execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust
relationship between their browser and the server.
