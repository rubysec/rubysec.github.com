  title: Unintended read access in kramdown gem
  description: |
    The kramdown gem before 2.3.0 for Ruby processes the template option inside
    Kramdown documents by default, which allows unintended read access (such as
    template="/etc/passwd") or unintended embedded Ruby code execution (such as a
    string that begins with template="string://<%= `). NOTE: kramdown is used in
    Jekyll, GitLab Pages, GitHub Pages, and Thredded Forum.
  cvss_v2: 7.5
  cvss_v3: 9.8
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 2.3.0"
