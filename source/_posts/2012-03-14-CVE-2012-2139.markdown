### CVE ID

* [CVE-2012-2139](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/81631)

### GEM NAME

* mail

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `>= 2.4.4`

### DESCRIPTION

Mail Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker to traverse outside of a restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks (e.g., ../../) supplied via the 'to' parameter within the delivery method. This directory traversal attack would allow the attacker to modify arbitrary files.
