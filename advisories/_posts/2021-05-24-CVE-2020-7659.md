  title: HTTP Request Smuggling in reel
  description: |
    reel through 0.6.1 allows Request Smuggling attacks due to incorrect
    Content-Length and Transfer encoding header parsing. It is possible to conduct HTTP
    request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header twice. Furthermore,
    invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be
    leveraged for TECL smuggling attacks. Note, This project is deprecated, and is not
    maintained any more.
