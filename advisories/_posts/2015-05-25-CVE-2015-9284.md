  title: CSRF vulnerability in OmniAuth's request phase
  date: 2015-05-25
  description: |
    The request phase of the OmniAuth Ruby gem is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery (CSRF) when used as part of the Ruby on Rails framework, allowing
    accounts to be connected without user intent, user interaction, or feedback to
    the user. This permits a secondary account to be able to sign into the web
    application as the primary account.

    In order to mitigate this vulnerability, Rails users should consider using the
    `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection` gem.
