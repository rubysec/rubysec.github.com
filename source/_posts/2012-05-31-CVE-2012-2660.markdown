### CVE ID

* [CVE-2012-2660](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/82610)

### GEM NAME

* activerecord

### FRAMEWORK

* rails

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 3.0.13`
* `~> 3.1.5`
* `>= 3.2.4`

### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails contains a flaw related to the way ActiveRecord handles
parameters in conjunction with the way Rack parses query parameters.
This issue may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary 'IS NULL' clauses in
to application SQL queries. This may also allow an attacker to have the
SQL query check for NULL in arbitrary places.
