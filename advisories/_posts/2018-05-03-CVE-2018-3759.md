  title: private_address_check Ruby Gem Time-of-check Time-of-use race condition
  date: 2018-05-03
  description: |
    private_address_check ruby gem before 0.5.0 is vulnerable to a time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU)
    race condition due to the address the socket uses not being checked. DNS entries with a TTL of 0
    can trigger this case where the initial resolution is a public address by the subsequent
    resolution is a private address.
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.5.0"
