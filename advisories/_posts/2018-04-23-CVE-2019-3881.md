  title: Insecure path handling in Bundler
  description: |
    Bundler prior to 2.1.0 uses a predictable path in /tmp/, created with
    insecure permissions as a storage location for gems, if locations under the user's
    home directory are not available. If Bundler is used in a scenario where the user
    does not have a writable home directory, an attacker could place malicious code
    in this directory that would be later loaded and executed.
