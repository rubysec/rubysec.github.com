    Generated Select Tag Options XSS
  date: 2012-03-01
  description: "Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting
    (XSS) \nattack. This flaw exists because the application does not validate manually\ngenerated
    'select tag options' upon submission to\nactionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/form_options_helper.rb.
    This may allow a\nuser to create a specially crafted request that would execute
    arbitrary\nscript code in a user's browser within the trust relationship between
    their\nbrowser and the server.\n"
