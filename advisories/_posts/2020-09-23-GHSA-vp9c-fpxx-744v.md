  title: Validation bypass vulnerability
  description: |
    # Impact
    This vulnerability impacts users who rely on the last four digits of personnummer to
    be a _real_ personnummer.

    # Workaround
    The issue arises from the regular expression allowing the first three digits in the
    last four digits of the personnummer to be 000, which is invalid. To mitigate this
    without upgrading, a check on the last four digits can be made to make sure it's
    not 000x.
