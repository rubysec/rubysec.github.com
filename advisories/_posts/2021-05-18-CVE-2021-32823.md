  title: Potential Denial-of-Service in bindata
  description: |
    In bindata before version 2.4.10, there is a potential denial-of-service
    vulnerability. In affected versions, it is very slow for certain classes in BinData
    to be created. For example BinData::Bit100000, BinData::Bit100001, BinData::Bit100002,
    BinData::Bit<N>. In combination with `<user_input>.constantize` there is a potential
    for a CPU-based DoS. In version 2.4.10, bindata improved the creation time of Bits
    and Integers.
