### CVE ID

* [CVE-2012-1099](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/79727)

### GEM NAME

* actionpack

### FRAMEWORK

* rails

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 3.0.12`
* `~> 3.1.4`
* `>= 3.2.2`

### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting (XSS) 
attack. This flaw exists because the application does not validate manually
generated 'select tag options' upon submission to
actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/form_options_helper.rb. This may allow a
user to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary
script code in a user's browser within the trust relationship between their
browser and the server.
