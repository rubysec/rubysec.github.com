### CVE ID

* [CVE-2013-1854](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/jgJ4cjjS8FE)

### GEM NAME

* activerecord

### FRAMEWORK

* rails

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 2.3.18`
* `~> 3.1.12`
* `>= 3.2.13`

### DESCRIPTION

When a hash is provided as the find value for a query, the keys of
the hash may be converted to symbols. Carefully crafted requests can
coerce `params[:name]` to return a hash, and the keys to that hash
may be converted to symbols. Ruby symbols are not garbage collected,
so an attacker can initiate a denial of service attack by creating a
large number of symbols.
