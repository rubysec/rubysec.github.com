  title: Arbitrary Variants Via Query Parameters
  date: 2019-07-01
  description: |
    Due to unvalidated input, an attacker can pass in
    arbitrary variants via query parameters.

    If an application treats variants as trusted, this can
    lead to potential vulnerabilities like SQL injection
    or cross-site scripting (XSS). For instance:

    landing_page = field_test(:landing_page)
    Page.where("key = '#{landing_page}'")
  cvss_v3: 5.3
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 0.3.0"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.3.1"
