    \n----------- \nPutting the following monkey patch in an initializer can help
    to mitigate the \nissue: \n\n``` \nclass Rails::Html::PermitScrubber \n  alias
    :old_scrub :scrub \n  alias :old_skip_node? :skip_node? \n\n  def scrub(node)
    \n    if node.cdata? \n      text = node.document.create_text_node node.text \n
    \     node.replace text \n      return CONTINUE \n    end \n    old_scrub node
    \n  end \n\n  def skip_node?(node); node.text?; end \nend \n``` \n\nPatches \n-------
