  title: Injection/XSS in Redcarpet
  description: |
    Redcarpet is a Ruby library for Markdown processing. In Redcarpet before
    version 3.5.1, there is an injection vulnerability which can enable a cross-site
    scripting attack. In affected versions no HTML escaping was being performed when
    processing quotes. This applies even when the `:escape_html` option was being used.
  cvss_v3: 6.8
