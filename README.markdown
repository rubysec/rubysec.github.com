## What is Octopress?

Octopress is [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging at its finest.

1. **Octopress sports a clean responsive theme** written in semantic HTML5, focused on readability and friendliness toward mobile devices.
2. **Code blogging is easy and beautiful.** Embed code (with [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) styling) in your posts from gists, jsFiddle or from your filesystem.
3. **Third party integration is simple** with built-in support for Pinboard, Delicious, GitHub Repositories, Disqus Comments and Google Analytics.
4. **It's easy to use.** A collection of rake tasks simplifies development and makes deploying a cinch.
5. **Ships with great plug-ins** some original and others from the Jekyll community &mdash; tested and improved.

We love to see people contributing to Octopress, whether it's a bug report, feature suggestion or a pull request. At the moment, we try to keep the core slick and lean, focusing on basic blogging needs, so some of your suggestions might not find their way into Octopress. For those ideas, we started a [list of 3rd party plug-ins](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins), where you can link your own Octopress plug-in repositories. For the future, we're thinking about ways to easier add them them into our main releases.

=======
This is a theme for the blogging framework [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) that is based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

### It was extracted from my [blog](https://github.com/barmstrong/blog) and looks like this:

<a href="http://brianarmstrong.org"><img src="https://github.com/barmstrong/octopress-bootstrap/raw/master/source/assets/screenshot.png"  alt="Octopress Bootstrap"/></a>

Since it's just regular bootstrap you can of course add any bootstrap theme now (such as those at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/) or [wrapbootstrap.com](http://wrapbootstrap.com/)) and it should just work!

### To Do

Feel free to fork and submit back pull requests.

* It could still use some cleanup (I extracted it from my site so some things may not be applicable everywhere)
* Bootstrap uses Less and Octopress uses Sass, so for right now I've just included plain CSS from bootstrap to make them compatible.  This works fine but ideally down the road it could use a forked Sass version of bootstrap or modify Octopress to include Less support.  One caveat is that it should ideally still work with the free bootstrap themes such those at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/) which are in Less.  So maybe there is some happy combination where these will all work together?  In the mean time this theme just uses plain old css.
