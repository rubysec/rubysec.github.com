### CVE ID

* [CVE-2013-0155](http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/89025)

### GEM NAME

* activerecord

### FRAMEWORK

* rails

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 2.3.16`
* `~> 3.0.19`
* `~> 3.1.10`
* `>= 3.2.11`

### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails contains a flaw in the Active Record. The issue is due to an
error with the way the Active Record handles parameters combined with an
error during the parsing of the JSON parameters. This may allow a remote
attacker to bypass restrictions abd issue unexpected database queries with
"IS NULL" or empty where clauses, and forcing the query to unexpectedly check
for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause.
