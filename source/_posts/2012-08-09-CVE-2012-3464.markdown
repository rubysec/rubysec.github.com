### CVE ID

* [CVE-2012-3464](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/84516)

### GEM NAME

* activesupport

### FRAMEWORK

* rails

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 3.0.17`
* `~> 3.1.8`
* `>= 3.2.8`

### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack. This flaw exists because the HTML escaping code functionality does
not properly escape a single quote character. This may allow a user to create
a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a
user's browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the
server.
