  title: Incorrect handling of initialization vector in the GCM mode in OpenSSL
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    The openssl gem for Ruby uses the same initialization vector (IV) in
    GCM Mode (aes-*-gcm) when the IV is set before the key, which makes it easier for
    context-dependent attackers to bypass the encryption protection mechanism.
