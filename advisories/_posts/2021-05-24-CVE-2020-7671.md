  title: HTTP Request Smuggling in goliath
  description: |
    goliath through 1.0.6 allows request smuggling attacks where goliath
    is used as a backend and a frontend proxy also being vulnerable. It is possible
    to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header twice.
    Furthermore, invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid
    which could be leveraged for TE:CL smuggling attacks.
  cvss_v3: 7.5
